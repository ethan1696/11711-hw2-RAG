For more detail on the Capital Budget and what it funds, please refer to the 2025 Capital Budget document. Community Development Funds are funded primarily by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). These funds are earmarked for projects relating to housing, economic development, and human services needs in neighborhoods with a high concentration of low- to moderate-income households. Special Revenue Funds are funds in which a substantial portion of the proceeds or inflows are restricted or committed for a specific purpose. Examples of these include the Liquid Fuels Fund, the Pittsburgh Partnership Fund, and the Grants Fund. While they are included in this document, the City only sets formal appropriations for two of the funds: the Stop the Violence Fund, and the Parks Tax Fund.", "title": null, "url": "https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/4/omb/documents/operating-budgets/2025-operating-budget.pdf", "word_count": 148}

The area became a battleground when France and Great Britain fought for control in the 1750s. When the British were victorious, the French ceded control of territories east of the Mississippi. Following American independence in 1783, the village around Fort Pitt continued to grow. The region saw the short-lived Whiskey Rebellion, when farmers rebelled against federal taxes on whiskey. The War of 1812 cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture.

Workers protested against cuts in wages, burning down buildings at the railyards, including 100 train engines and more than 1,000 cars. Forty men were killed, most of them strikers. By 1911, Pittsburgh was producing half the nation's steel. Pittsburgh was a Republican party stronghold until 1932.

Ethnic neighborhoods developed in working-class areas and were built on densely populated hillsides and valleys, such as South Side, Polish Hill, Bloomfield, and Squirrel Hill, home to 28% of the city's almost 21,000 Jewish households.[62] The Strip District, the city's produce distribution center, still boasts many restaurants and clubs that showcase these multicultural traditions of Pittsburghers.[39] The years 1916–1940 marked the largest migration of African Americans to Pittsburgh during the Great Migration from the rural South to industrial cities of the Northeast and Midwest. These migrants came for industrial jobs, education, political and social freedom, and to escape racial oppression and violence in the South. Migrants going to Pittsburgh and surrounding mill towns faced racial discrimination and restricted housing and job opportunities.", "title": "History of Pittsburgh - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Pittsburgh", "word_count": 139}

Across sketches, paintings, photographs, and self-portraits, Warhol returned over and over to one of the most immediate and fundamental reminders that life can’t go on forever. His skulls capture Warhol’s ability to balance dark and light in his art. They represent death, of course, but they also bring out the artist’s humor, Morgan says: “The skulls almost look like they’re grinning.” For his part, Moore found them energizing and exciting; prints of Warhol’s skulls hung in his office when he worked at the museum.", "title": "Mortality in Mind - Carnegie Magazine", "url": "https://carnegiemuseums.org/carnegie-magazine/winter-2025/mortality-in-mind/", "word_count": 132}

More than a dozen shadows appear in the exhibition, photographed by Warhol and then abstracted in a range of bold colors and screenprinted with diamond dust. They have a melancholy quality, Moore notes, and there’s something mysterious in the way they obscure their subject for the viewer. That seems fitting, considering what the Shadows suggest. “They represent the thing that is maybe most temporal in the world,” Moore says. “A shadow is only a shadow until the light moves in a different direction—and then it disappears.” The Only Inevitability A small selection of Warhol’s film work adds another dimension to Vanitas , including Empire , an eight-hour-long silent marathon that offers a close study of the passage of time around the Empire State Building, viewed through a stationary camera.", "title": "Mortality in Mind - Carnegie Magazine", "url": "https://carnegiemuseums.org/carnegie-magazine/winter-2025/mortality-in-mind/", "word_count": 148}

The 1963 film Sleep , meanwhile, spends five hours watching Warhol’s boyfriend and muse, John Giorno, in repose. Like much of the exhibition, it encourages consideration of the blurred line between life and death, Moore says. “There’s this worshipful gaze—because Giorno was very beautiful—that Warhol had, but also he is laying there inert and it looks like he’s dead,” Moore notes. “There’s this idea of life and death toggling back and forth.” Warhol’s contemplation—and even celebration—of life’s temporality draws a parallel across the centuries with the Dutch paintings he likely saw when he visited the Rijksmuseum in 1956.", "title": "Mortality in Mind - Carnegie Magazine", "url": "https://carnegiemuseums.org/carnegie-magazine/winter-2025/mortality-in-mind/", "word_count": 147}
